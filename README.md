## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources, following only the instructions given on the prework.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Initially, I was afraid that my lack of knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript would make this project difficult. Though I was relieved to see that I was being provided with enough to build the code.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
What sort of process does a developer go through when building a website for someone? Do compromises have to be made, based on scope of the project, or demands from the person employing the developer? How does managing a project with a looming deadline go? Could you provide an example in which you had to work on a project while on tight deadline?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to commit to working on this project. The way I am ordering this is in order of what I wanted to add the most to what I wanted to the least. I would likely be working on some of the optional features, most notably the computer makinga different pattern for each time the game is played. I would have also spent more time on providing an aesthetic that is not as generic. In addition I would have loved to changed to the pitches for the buttons in order for it sound like the Weezer song, Say It Ain't So. The last thing I would have done was add a timer so players could have a limited amount of time to guess the pattern.
